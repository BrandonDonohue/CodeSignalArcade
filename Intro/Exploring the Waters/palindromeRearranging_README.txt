CHALLENGE:
Given a string, find out if its characters can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

EXAMPLE:
For inputString = "aabb", the output should be palindromeRearranging(inputString) = true.
	- We can rearrange "aabb" to make "abba", which is a palindrome.

I/O:

[execution time limit]: 0.5 seconds (cpp)

[input]: string inputString
	- A string consisting of lowercase English letters.

Guaranteed constraints:
1 ≤ inputString.length ≤ 50.

[output]: boolean
    - True if the characters of the inputString can be rearranged to form a palindrome
    - False otherwise.
