# CodeSignalArcade
Collection of "arcade" coding exercises completed on CodeSignal "https://app.codesignal.com/arcade"

**SPECIAL NOTE:**  
These .cpp files will not compile as is because they were done on the website's own IDE which has its own compiler and test cases.  
They are meant to show algorithms, solutions, or ideas I had for each challenge and also act as a reference for myself.
