# CodeSignalArcade
Collection of "arcade" coding exercises completed on CodeSignal "https://app.codesignal.com/arcade"

**SPECIAL NOTE:**  
These .cpp files will not compile as they are because they were done on the website's own IDE.  
From my understanding, these challenges were meant to focus on problem solving and typically only deal with a single function.   So, just like if someone asked you for help with their project, you wouldn't be creating a whole new project with a main function, test cases, etc.
